I'm currently studying computer science at KU.  I've taken the following courses:  Programming 1 and 2 (both in C++), Discrete Structures, Digital Logic Design, Theory of Computing, Embedded Systems, and Data Structures.  Right now I'm enrolled in Software Engineering 1, Intro to Communication Networks, and Intro to Machine Learning.

I have a B.A. in Psychology, also from KU.  Prior to resuming my studies, I worked for several years in software support for companies such as Cerner and ADP.  I also worked as a technical writer for a few years.  I took a break from work to be a full-time parent.
